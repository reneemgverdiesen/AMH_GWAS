# GWAS meta-analysis of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in 7049 premenopausal women

This repository includes code used to perform analyses for the manuscript 'Genome-wide association study meta-analysis identifies three novel loci for circulating  anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone levels in women' (available on bioRxiv: xxx). In addition, the summary-level GWAS results from this project can be found in this respository.


# Part 1: Code

# 1. 1_EasyQC_FilelevelQC.ecf
Script for performing file-level QC of all study-specific files, using EasyQC (referentie). This script is based on ...

# 2. 2_EasyQC_MetalevelQC.ecf
Script for performing meta-level QC of all study-specific files, using EasyQC (referentie). This script is based on ..

2_EasyQC_MetalevelQC.ecf includes the following steps:
1. Create SE-N plot
2. Create P-Z scatter plot
3. Alelle frequency check
4. Create QQ-plot 
5. Identification of population stratification

# 3. 3_Metal_metaanalysis_phet.txt
Script for performing the main AMH GWAS meta-analysis in METAL (xx).

# 4. 4_GCTA_conditionalanalysis.sh
Script for performing approximate conditional and joint association analysis using GCTA (referentie).

# 5. 5_DEPICT_pathwayanalysis.xx
Scipt for performing pathway analysis using DEPICT (ref). For this analysis we included all suggestive significant SNPs (p < 5 x 10-6), which were clumped at LD r2 < 0.1 and a physical distance of 500kb using PLINK v.1.9 as part of the DEPICT pipeline (ref).
